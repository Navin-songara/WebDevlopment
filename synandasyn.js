// Synchronous and asynchronous
            OR 
// Blocking And non-blocking method

// Blocking Method Execute Synchronously. step by step execution means that the program 
// is executed line. The program waits until the called function or the operation returns.

// Non-blocking methods execute asynchronously. it refers to the program that does not 
// block the execution of further operation . Non-blocking methods are execute 
// asychronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line .
// The program calls the function and move to the next operation does not wait for
// it ot return.

// Java Script library provides named class for implanention of Asynchronize programming
